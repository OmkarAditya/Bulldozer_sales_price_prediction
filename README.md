# Bulldozer_sales_price_prediction

#### Predicting the sale price of bulldozers using Machine Learning (Time series data)

## This is a REGRESSION problem with TIME SERIES DATA
 * Data size > **412K** entries



### 1. Problem Defination
> Given the details (various features) of Bulldozers sold from year 1989 to 2012 and their price (train set and validation set) we need to prdict the price of bulldozers sold **after 2012** (test set)



### 2. Data
The data is downloaded from the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition
https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview

### 3. Evaluation

The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.

Note: The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model which minimises RMSLE.
